# TNPublicSchools

## Motivation

I've always loved working with government data, and I've always had an interest in public policy; so doing a project on Tennessee Public Schools seemed a natural choice since the public school system produces a lot of data and is always at the center of the public debate. 

## Objectives

I had two objectives in doing this project. The first was to create and enterprise dashboard that would allow the user to see the performance of the TN public school system (all public schools across the state) at the district and individual school level. Currently, in my opinion, the state’s interface for accessing school information (https://reportcard.tnedu.gov/) could be greatly improved by putting school information into one view and by making it easier to compare one school against its peers. The dashboard I designed had this goal as its primary purpose.

My second objective was to conduct a population study that utilizes census data to determine how representative schools are of their communities. This objective was partially inspired by reporting from WPLN’s ‘The Promise’ podcast that began airing in August 2020. In their reporting they highlighted two schools in East Nashville that were complete opposites in their racial composition (Warner Elementary, 89% African American, and Lockeland Elementary, 88% White) but only a mile apart. I wanted to determine if this instance of resegregation was isolated or also occurring elsewhere across the district and the state.
